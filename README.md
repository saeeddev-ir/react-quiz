# Project 16: React-Quiz

## Description: 
  React Quiz is one of my lovely projects that I've created with React & Vite. 
  This project is built with useReducer to manage all of my complex states based on reducer function & dispatch. 
  As the first perspective, you would see a header, some texts and a button to start the quiz. Whenever you click the button, you see the questions & all its options and a timer. 
  When you select one of the options, you can see the correct answer, Next btn and a progressBar. 
  After answering all the questions, the app calculates your points & see the result as the finish screen. 
  Finally, you are able to restart the quiz when necessary.
